This program was completed using pair programming. 
Partner: Sejal Chadha (schadha2@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Rahul Patel (rpate3@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge each parter in a programming pair 
should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is 
working 
together, and at most 25% of an individualâ€™s 
effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a 
solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object 
is to work
together, learning from each other, not to 
divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a 
different piece.

Rahul Patel spent 5 hours working alone. 
Sejal Chadha spent 5 hours working alone. 

We spent 12 hours working together. 
Rahul Patel spent 6 hours driving. 
Sejal Chadha spent 6 hours driving.
